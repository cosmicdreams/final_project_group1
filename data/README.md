# Final Group Project
Module 20: Final Project.  This is our group project for Data Science Bootcamp.  Below is one of the different proposed final projects.

---

## Project Topic:
**Dow vs Weather** is one of the proposed projects.

### Summary:
Use machine learning to analyze Down Jones historical performance and US weather (major cities) to determine if there is association/influence by the weather or if any other correlations can be drawn.

### Datasets:
At least two different datasets are required for this project: DJI historical performance and Historical weather from US major cities.
-	DJI Dataset:
    - 1992 to 2022:
        - https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/history/
    - Weather Dataset:
        - https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Compiled_daily_temperature_and_precipitation_data_for_the_U_S_cities/7890488?file=32874374


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The process of performing initial investigations on the data to clean, organize and plot (if necessary) will be as follows:
-	Download the datasets previously noted.
-	Use **Pytho**n with the **Pandas** library to import, clean and organize the datasets:


### Database:
-	The cleaned datasets will be stored in **PostgreSQL** database/tables.
    - See SQL Folder

### Machine Learning Model:
-	Classification or Regression predictive modeling can be used with this dataset:
    - Classification is the task of predicting a discrete class label.
    - Regression is the task of predicting a continuous quantity.


### Final Decision:
- Pending as other proposed projects are also being reviewed.
